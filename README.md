# My developer journey

This is a log about my learning process, a permanent WIP.

## The backstory

Since my teenage years, I've revolved around computers and other electronics and machines. While I've always found hardware interesting, it never caught my eye for further studying. With software the thing was entirely different: I spent lots of hours after school customizing and tinkering around with videogames mods, setting up blogs on Blogger, and even trying to make an entire community site with my cousin using [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/).

When it was time to start college I decided on industrial engineering, and I got little to no time to allocate to side projects related to software. I got close to math and statistics, and my friend was (and still is) Excel. In the last year, I took some optional simulation classes in which I learned a little bit of Scilab and R. Getting some interest in R for its simplicity, I ended up knowing about Python and all its virtues, quickly found Al Sweigart's [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) book and got my first real experience with a programming language, but never got to master the language to make useful stuff.
Later, when I started working, I only used Excel and Power BI, and all the positions for industrial engineers were for managing resources, it didn't bore me, but Iâ€™ve always felt like something was missing.

After a couple of job changes, I ended up working for a small software company in my city as a project manager. I spent a lot of time with the development team and was amazed by their work and shortly I knew I needed to experience that. I tried to study some things, but I didn't have the time it requires for getting a good grasp. I've used to find myself up looking at a blank screen not knowing what to do after hours of following tutorials. So, I took the hard decision to quit my job and start from zero on a new path: learning how to *actually* build software and make a living out of it.


## The doubt

So, I wanted to make software. The first thing It popped up on my mind was: ok, I like video games, I like data and finance, I like to tinker with my 3D printer, etc., is there a one-size-fits-all programming language? 

I then asked a couple of developer friends and all answers can be resumed in the following three programming languages:

- ***Python:*** Friendly for beginners, multipurpose, good for data and statistics, it can be used to control a 3D printer, and it even has good libraries like [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/), used to make visual novels, one of my favorite video games genres.

- ***C#:*** Modern and robust programming language, excellent for video games, it's used to create scripts within Unity and other video game engines. Used for both web and desktop applications. Not so easy for beginners.

- ***JavaScript:*** The programming language of the web, you can do virtually anything with it, and nowadays it's all there! Desktop apps are being replaced by web apps at the vertiginous level. There are a good amount of video games done with it, and on top of all is one of the most recommended languages for beginners. 

The next thing I asked myself was. What about the market? I need to find a job after all! What are the most demanded roles in the industry? After a couple of searches on LinkedIn and Glassdoor, I found out that web developers are the most demanded.

Then again, I asked my friends what about being a web developer. And they explained to me that there isn't a unique kind of web developer. There can be, front-end developers, back-end developers, and full-stack developers, and it all depends on the technological stack they specialize in.

## The decision

Taking all in consideration, I decided that the best way of doing something I enjoy while I can also make a living out of it, is to become a web developer, and especially if get to become a full stack developer, that would allow me to develop more solutions in the future, making it the most optimal decision.

## The path

After deciding I would go for web development I spent a couple of weeks doing some thorough research. I went deep down the rabbit hole searching for the answer: forums, blogs, subreddits, Twitter, universities curriculums, paid courses and bootcamps, etc.

Again, there's no such thing as one-size-fits-all learning. And I had to make my curriculum based on my learning style.

I summed it all up in these 6 general steps:

0. Learning about the internet and the web: What are both? What happens when I use a web browser and write something in the search bar? What is a server? etc.

1. Learning JavaScript: Complete a basic course, and be able to create solutions for different problems.

2. Getting the fundamentals of HTML & CSS: Understanding the structure of a website and how to style it at a basic level.

3. Getting to combine the two of the above: understanding how does JavaScript combines with HTML & CSS and what can be done with it.

4. Learning front-end libraries, supersets, and frameworks: How to get the best out of JavaScript.

5. Learning about back-end: Back-end technologies, programming languages, databases, etc.

*And while I'm doing everything from step 1: I will need to learn and practice with version control systems like Git.*

## Kick Off: freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

While I started my journey with the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP), I just did the very basics of their curriculum "Foundations" of how the web works and started getting my feet wet with really general stuff.

After that, I jumped right into JavaScript. I did this course to get a good grasp of basic algorithms and data structures. It was super easy to use, and it teaches you to step by step the basics, having an integrated IDE with a console, and automated testing built-in where you can run your code and verify if it works properly saves you a lot of time as a beginner and lets you concentrate on just learning the language.

Results:

- A couple of [basic programs](https://github.com/herlnd/fcc-js-exercises) that run on a console:

- This [nice certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/herlnd/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures) from fCC

## Fundamentals: The Odin Project

After completing the JavaScript course of fCC, I returned to TOP and continued with their [Foundations curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), where I learn about HTML structure, CSS styling and refresh the JavaScript basics.

I'm currently working my way into this curriculum. So far the results are:

- A [recipes page](https://github.com/herlnd/odin-recipes) in plain HTML (need to revisit it later)
- A [landing page](https://github.com/herlnd/odin-landing) using the flexbox tools.
- A [Rock Paper Scissors game](https://github.com/herlnd/odin-rps) (WIP)
